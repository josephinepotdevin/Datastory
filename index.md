In 2006, Tarana Burke, activist and sexual assault survivor, creates the MeToo movement in support to all women victims of crimes of sexual nature. It is only in October 2017, when more than 80 women in the film industry made sexual abuse allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein, that the MeToo movement re-emerged. The actress Alyssa Milano is the one who reignited the movement by encouraging victims of sexual harassment and assault to come forward using the hashtag #MeToo as a status update on Twitter. With the goal of raising awareness of sexual misconduct, empowering survivors to speak out, helping them heal as a community and not as an individual on his own, and bringing them justice, the MeToo movement has spread around the world, showing the reality and magnitude of sexual abuse against women.
